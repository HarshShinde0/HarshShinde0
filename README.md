# Hi, I'm [Harsh Shinde](http://harshshinde.me/)

I am an open-source developer, I have honed my skills and cultivated a deep passion for continuous learning. With a solid foundation in web development.Beyond the realm of coding, I find solace and inspiration in the harmonious melodies of music. I am an avid reader, indulging in novels that transport me to different worlds and ignite my imagination.In my quest for growth, I embrace the opportunity to explore and learn new coding languages during my free time. Each new language represents a gateway to expanding my repertoire and broadening my problem-solving capabilities.
